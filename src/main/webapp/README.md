##Building a Drag-n-Drop Interface
Drag and drop is almost a goto way for various user interactions. More often than not, drag and drop functionality required is quite simple and easily solved by jQuery UI or other frameworks. Things start to get murky when you are working with an iframe (as always!) or need to mould the drag and drop to your needs.

Thankfully, HTML5 brought a native way to handle drag and drop events which should have made things simpler but that wasn’t the case. HTML5 Drag and Drop is still quite raw and full of gray areas. It doesn’t help that debugging drag and drop is quite painful most of the times.

Creating a Drag and Drop interface (like StackHive) required a lot of fiddling around with the HTML5 DnD API. After a lot searching around for articles and resources that would be more relevant for my use case, I came up short. So, after spending a lot of time on it I decided to roll it out as an open source plugin.
